# PersonnelManagement
PersonnelManagement is a Java-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage and organize information about students, faculty, and staff. The script handles various details and provides outputs in both console and file formats.

## Project Overview
The PersonnelManagement application is structured to store and manage information in a clear and organized manner. It uses arrays to hold data for three distinct categories:

-  **Students**: Contains information such as GPA, credit hours, name, ID, and tuition due.
-  **Faculty**: Holds details like department, rank, name, and ID.
-  **Staff**: Includes data on department, status, name, and ID.
### Features
-  **User Input**: The application allows users to input data for students, faculty, and staff.
-  **Data Storage**: Information is stored in respective arrays for easy management and retrieval.
-  **Output**: The program provides a console output and a file output of the details for each entity, using an overridden print function to format the data.
-  **Error Handling**: Utilizes try-catch statements to handle potential errors during input and processing.
-  **Iterative Input**: Implements do-while loops to allow multiple entries until the user decides to stop.
### How It Works
1.  **Input Collection**: Users input details for students, faculty, and staff. The data is stored in arrays based on the type of entity.
2.  **Data Output**: Once all data is input, the program displays the information using an overridden print function. The output is shown in the console and written to a file.
3.  **Error Handling**: The application uses try-catch blocks to manage exceptions and ensure smooth operation.
4.  **Iterative Process**: The use of do-while loops facilitates repeated data entry until the user completes the input process.
